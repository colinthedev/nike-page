## About :point_down:

A single page nike clone redeisgned by me.
<br>
 * One of my first projects

This project was created from scratch using flexbox for the main layout.
<br>
<br>
Using only flexbox for the entire layout made making this more difficult than it needed to be but i was looking to get more practice with flexbox at the time.
<br>
* I built this with the intention of having a project that i can expand on as i learn more. I would like to add a shopping cart functionality, interactive images, and color selection for the shoes in the future. 
<br>

Deployed using [Github-pages](https://colinthedev.github.io/nike-page/)

## Design :paintbrush: 

I used **figma** to create the design. 
<br>
<br>
The goal was to create a layout that was clear and engaging. 
<br>
<br>

## Final Considerations 

This project was great practice to strengthen my flexbox knowledge.
